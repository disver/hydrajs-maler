## Introduction

Hydra is a JavaScript library for working with and building Canvas views.

Â Â  In the past few months, our team built a configuration diagram using Javascript due to the needs of the work.
We made a lot of comparisons in many libraries, and finally settled the program using the game engine (`Cocos2dx`).

Â Â  The reason is simple, because Cocos has a lot of out-of-the-box visual editing tools that will bring us great efficiency.
After completing the task, we also made some reflections. Obviously, it is unreasonable to use a game engine to build such a page.
Â Â  This way will bring a lot of inconvenience in subsequent maintenance, one of which is code separation (the visual tool we use is `Cocos Creator`, which needs to reference the code after building).
At the same time, the form of iframe embedding also makes many elements of the page uncontrollable.

Â Â  After the free time, we decided to develop a Canvas view framework in the team meeting, which can be used to conveniently build the view, so Hydra.js was born.

## Documentation

We are speeding up the creation of documents, which will be published later on `Git Page`.
